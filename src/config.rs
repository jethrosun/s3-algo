// DRAFT
//
// Now, we don't have "avg_min_bytes". Because... we will just substract the assumed constant
// anyway.
// What if the assumption is wrong?
// Well, it should be rather small anyway. It is exclusively thought to be the RTT...
// If the substraction is negative after all...? Then... idk

// put_timeout_per_byte..?
//  should configure it as an assumed MBPS just like before. expected_upload_speed.
// delete_timeout_per_object..?
//  quite straight-forward seconds per object
